# Computer Vision no libraries
## Assignment 1


### Assignment Report

For this assignment, you will have to write the code without the use of computer vision libraries
(other than to use functions to read and write images).
You can implement the assignment in any programming language. Submit your code in addition
to the assignment report. The assignment can be completed in teams of two.

### Assignment Report

1. Choose an 8-bit colored image and convert it to a grayscale image. Explain your
approach and show the input and output image.

-Vicente

2. Add white gaussian noise to the grayscale image. Show the effects of the noise when
the standard deviation is 1, 10 and 30 and 50.

-June

3. Add Salt and Pepper noise to 10% and 30% of the pixels in the grayscale image in 1.
Salt and Pepper noise is added to an image by adding random bright and random dark
pixels all over the image.

-Vicente

4. Implement a Box Filter, Median Filter and Gaussian Filter to remove the white gaussian
noise with standard deviation 50 and the Salt and Pepper noise at 30%. Let the kernel
size be 3 x 3. Explain your choice of other parameters and any non-trivial steps in your
implementation (e.g., how did you handle the borders in the image).

-June

5. Vary the kernel size to 5 x 5 and 10 x 10 and show its effect on the output image
